Talk about index again.

The markets would fail.

Sometimes it's refreshing to read Barron's stock-picking analysis, yet I am no longer interested in
simple buy-and-hold strategy for individual stocks now. I don't trust analysts either now. Put up
a [predictionbook entry](https://predictionbook.com/predictions/194116) for Barron's another prediction

## Movies
[Salò](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073650/)  
To be honest, this is a pretty average movie. It is more a political outcry.
However I do think desensitized society nowadays needs more disturbing
cinematic work like Salò than conforming cheap garbage produced Hollywood
like La La Land.

[Cold War](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6543652/)  
The [theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxFsK7xKRPM) is so beautiful.
Many Polish films have similar setting: Polish people who left their countries
struggle with their identity in foreign country and miss their motherland.

## Others
1. Tried Quantopian which is quite good. Python is familiar to me and I prefer it to R.
Of course, I prefer some Camel library but there is no good one.
