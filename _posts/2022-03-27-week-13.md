> Turning to price stability, the inflation outlook had deteriorated
> significantly this year even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

>  It continues to seem likely that hoped-for supply-side healing will come
>  over time as the world ultimately settles into some new normal, but the
>  timing and scope of that relief are highly uncertain. In the meantime, as we
>  set policy, we will be looking to actual progress on these issues and not
>  assuming significant near-term supply-side relief.

> However, the risk is rising that an extended period of high inflation could
> push longer-term expectations uncomfortably higher, which underscores the
> need for the Committee to move expeditiously as I have described.
