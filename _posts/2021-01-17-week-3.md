Dr Lacy Hunt: secular inflation cycle is not coming. Bond bull run is
still intact.

Brainard on FAIT.

> The September 2020 FOMC statement adopted outcome-based forward guidance for
the policy rate tied to shortfalls from maximum employment and 2 percent
average inflation, and the December 2020 FOMC statement adopted outcome-based
forward guidance for asset purchases.

> the timing of liftoff will **depend on realized progress** toward maximum employment and 2 percent average inflation.

Note the emphasis on "realized".

>  While disentangling inflation expectations from liquidity and term premiums is
imprecise, staff models attribute a significant portion of the movement in
inflation compensation to an increase in expectations, bringing them up from
the lows seen in March but still below their historical averages.

Fed staff thinks inflation comp increase mostly attributes to expectation.

>  The Committee has stated clearly that it needs to see substantial further
progress toward our goals before adjusting purchases. The economy is far away
from our goals in terms of both employment and inflation, and even under an
optimistic outlook, it will take time to achieve substantial further progress.

Don't expect tapering any time soon.
