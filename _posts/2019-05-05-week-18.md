[BBG Opinion: Central Banks Have Broken Capitalism](
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-26/capitalism-is-broken-because-of-central-banks)

Author's three arguments against central banks' current monetary policies
are the arguments I see most often: instability by asset bubble and corporate
indebtedness, capital productivity, and social inequality.

MMT does not hold when economy is operating normally. It should not
be used to justify proposals from "populist politicians who want to ignore
the established constraints of macroeconomics".

Fed holds rates unchanged as expected. Treasury yield dips on weak inflation
reading and possible rate cut this year.

## Debt and Credit

[WSJ: Negative Yields Deepen Along With Europe’s Problems](
https://www.wsj.com/articles/negative-yields-deepen-along-with-europes-problems-11556535601)

Europe economy outlook is so bad that yield spread between 10y Treasury
and 10y Bund is at 3% now. Investors also choose not to hedge against currency
risk because the chance of Euro becoming stronger is deemed little.

[FT: Why the Fed changed direction but the dollar did not](
https://www.ft.com/content/362f1c62-6afd-11e9-80c7-60ee53e6681d)

Strong dollar since Fed's dovish U-turn has been confusing. However, considering
weak data in other G10 countries compared with still strong economy data
in U.S, along with other central banks' even more dovish stance, dollar is
still holding strong.

> The dollar is the best house in a bad neighbourhood

However, some analysts believe current dollar trend is not sustainable
and global economy data is due for a rebound late this year.

Author also mentioned that strong dollar gives pressure to U.S. stock market
because it can hurt companies' foreign earnings. Strong dollar is also
a threat to emerging market. Lira and Pesos declined a lot YTD.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/dollar-aloft-near-multiyear-highs-as-investors-parse-data-fed-11557057601)

> Some investors, however, believe the high concentration of dollar
bets makes the currency vulnerable to a rapid decline if sentiment changes.
