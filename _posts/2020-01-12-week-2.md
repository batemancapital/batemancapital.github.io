[Federal Reserve System: Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, December 10â€“11, 2019](
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20191211.htm)

FOMC December meeting Minutes is out.

Fed summarized its series of _Fed Listens_ events:

> Regarding inflation, participants recognized that segments of the public
generally do not regard the fact that aggregate inflation is
running modestly below the Committee's 2 percent goal as a problem.

However, Fed is determined to bring 2 percent inflation back and feels
need to communicate better with the public about its goal.

Fed also mentioned it is possible that the Desk will be ordered to
buy short-term coupon-bearing Treasuries when liquidity in Treasury
bill market drains:

> The first involved the risk that future Treasury bill purchases could have a
larger effect on liquidity in the Treasury bill market in light of expected
seasonal declines in bill issuance and the Federal Reserve's growing ownership
share of outstanding bills. If this risk were to materialize, the Federal
Reserve could consider expanding the universe of securities purchased for
reserve management purposes to include coupon-bearing Treasury securities
with a short time to maturity.

FOMC participants also voiced concern over financial instability brought
by a persistent low interest rate environment:

> A few participants raised the concern that keeping interest rates low over
a long period might encourage excessive risk-taking, which could
exacerbate imbalances in the financial sector.

The Desk is ordered to keep purchasing T-Bills at least into Q2 2020 and
conducting repo at least into January 2020.
