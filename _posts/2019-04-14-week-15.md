of our life.

[FT: Uber: more tussle than hustle](
https://www.ft.com/content/5a30597e-5cb0-11e9-939a-341f5ada9d40)

Lex column of FT seems to be a historically distinguished column [^2]. Analysis
from this column is succinct and impartial. It resorts to _the fundamental_.

Noland's weekly note blog is the best I've read. This one touches on comments
by German economist Dr. Kurt Richebacher.

> It was fundamental to Dr. Richebacher’s analysis that Bubbles destroy
wealth. He spared no wrath when it came to central bankers believing wealth
would be created through the aggressive expansion of “money” and Credit. 

> This is an important reminder of a fundamental aspect of
Bubble Analysis: Bubbles inflate underlying “fundamentals.”

Midtown Uniform.

[NYT: In San Francisco, Making a Living From Your Billionaire Neighbor’s Trash](

Miserable city.

[FT Opinion: Why the elite media are surviving in this populist age](
https://www.ft.com/content/a2596610-5b1f-11e9-9dde-7aedca0a081a)

> A reader introduced himself as “an FT/Economist liberal”. Elite media are becoming clubs

As a loyal FT reader, I don't understand why NYT is also elite media. I think
NYT coverage appeals to the crowd while FT coverage maintains its cold and distant
stance. Probably another reason why FT is considered elitism is that it keeps
a much higher subscription fee. See also Amber A'Lee Frost's criticism on
NYT [^1].

[FT Opinion: Why I’d always bet on the city](
https://www.ft.com/content/a8034138-5b6c-11e9-9dde-7aedca0a081a)

Exactly. That's why I prefer international metropolitan city.
