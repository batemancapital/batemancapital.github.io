[Finanz und Wirtschaft: Gundlach: «US equities will lose the most»](
https://www.fuw.ch/article/gundlach-us-equities-will-lose-the-most/)

Gundlach made an interesting point: Fed's plan of monetizing T-Bills encourages
issuance of T-Bills. If the Treasury issues 10yr or 30yr bonds instead, the long-term
interest rates would rise. This means to some extent Fed is suppressing
long-term interest rates.

Plus, Gundlach pointed out "it was unthinkable that the Fed would buy bonds".
It is certainly possible that unconventional monetary and fiscal policy
keep evolving in the future.

[FT Opinion (Janan Ganesh): How to choose your friends wisely](
https://www.ft.com/content/e4ea70d0-fbc6-11e9-a354-36acbbb0d9b6)

> What enriches life is not the number of your friendships. It is not even the
depth of them. It is the range. Young people starting out in the big city
should beware ghettoisation by profession. What we are now obliged to call
their “networks” should fan out as wide as possible. And ensuring
that they do is itself a career.

I cannot agree Janan's advice anymore.
