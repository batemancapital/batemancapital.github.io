[Lael Brainard: Bringing the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy into Alignment with Longer-Run Changes in the Economy](
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20200901a.htm)

> The longstanding presumption that accommodation should be reduced
> preemptively when the unemployment rate nears the neutral rate in
> anticipation of high inflation that is unlikely to materialize risks an
> unwarranted loss of opportunity for many Americans.

> Flexible average inflation targeting is a pragmatic way to implement a makeup
> strategy, which is essential to arrest any downward drift in inflation
> expectations


> With a flat Phillips curve and low inflation, the Committee would have to
> sustain the federal funds rate below the neutral rate for much longer in
> order to push inflation back to target sustainably. The resulting expectation
> of lower-for-longer interest rates, along with sustained high rates of
> resource utilization, is conducive to increasing risk appetite,
> reach-for-yield behavior, and incentives for leverage—which can boost
> financial imbalances as an expansion extends. In this way, the combination of
> a low neutral rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation can
> lead to more cyclical volatility in asset prices. With financial stability
> risks more tightly linked to the business cycle, it is vital to use
> macroprudential as well as standard prudential tools as the first line of
> defense in order to allow monetary policy to remain focused on achieving
> maximum employment and 2 percent average inflation

Fed officials are aware of the risk to financial asset brought by long
period of low interest rate.

> Encouragingly, the housing sector has rebounded strongly from its initial
> decline, supported by historically low mortgage rates, and consumer spending
> on goods has held up well, in part reflecting earlier fiscal support

Fed offcial noted the recent housing market rebound. 

> With the recovery likely to face COVID-19-related headwinds for some time, in
> coming months, it will be important for monetary policy to pivot from
> stabilization to accommodation.

Brainard hints at more QE in September FOMC meeting.
