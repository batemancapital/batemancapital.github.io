### Central Banks / Economy

[Fed: Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida: U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy](
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/clarida20211012a.htm)

> But I continue to believe that the underlying rate inflation in the U.S.
> economy is hovering close to our 2 percent longer-run objective and, thus,
> that the unwelcome surge in inflation this year, once these relative price
> adjustments are complete and bottlenecks have unclogged, will in the end
> prove to be largely transitory.

>  That said, I believe, as do most of my colleagues, that the risks to inflation are to the upside

> In the context of our new framework, as I have noted before, while the
> effective lower bound (ELB) can be a constraint on monetary policy, the ELB
> is not a constraint on fiscal policy, and appropriate monetary policy under
> our new framework, to me, must—and certainly can—incorporate this reality. 

This sentence is the key. Clarida believes the *appropriate monetary policy*
under new MPF should be considered with the backdrop of (unprecedented) fiscal policy
support. It sounds like a concession, or an indirect ack of the need to
slightly reconsider FAIT. 

Overall the speech smells hawkish.

[Fed: Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, September 21-22, 2021](
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20211013a.htm)

> In their discussion of inflation, participants observed that the inflation
> rate was elevated, and they expected that it would likely remain so in coming
> months before moderating. Participants marked up their inflation pro-
> jections, as they assessed that supply constraints in prod- uct and labor
> markets were larger and likely to be longer lasting than previously
> anticipated. Some participants expressed concerns that elevated rates of
> inflation could feed through into longer-term inflation expectations of
> households and businesses or saw recent inflation data as suggestive of
> broader inflation pressures.

Another hawkish lean in FOMC minutes.
