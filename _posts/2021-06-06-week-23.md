### Central Banks / Economy

[Fed: Remaining Steady as the Economy Reopens](

> The supplyâ€“demand mismatches at the sectoral level are making it difficult to
precisely assess inflationary developments and the amount of resource slack from month to month.

> Looking through the noise, I expect we will see further progress in coming
months, but the economy is far from our goals, and there are risks on both sides. 

> While the level of inflation in my near-term outlook has moved somewhat higher,
my expectation for the contour of inflation moving back towards its underlying
trend in the period beyond the reopening remains broadly unchanged.
