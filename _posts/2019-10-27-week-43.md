Three cuts are usually what Powell said "mid-cycle adjustment".
It is important to watch if Fed is willing to deliver more
cuts after October, as such move means Fed will break away from its
"mid-cycle adjustment".

[FT: The Money Market](

Found an interview FT conducted back in 2007 with second author of
Stigum's Money Market, Tony Crescenzi. Tony, along with many other
people back in 2007, were cautious about the economic outlook but
thought the correction would be contained. He was also worried about
inverted yield curve at that time, but said he cut the odds of recession
because "today's inversion is occurring in a low interest rate environment".
This remark echoes with recent Fed official's opinion that it is hard to
"extract the right signal from these probability models, especially in
the current period of unusually low levels of term premiums", according
to September FOMC minutes.
