[FT: ECB faces crucial test of credibility](
https://www.ft.com/content/bf105742-90d4-11e9-b7ea-60e35ef678d2)

> It is not the failure of its monetary stimulus that has forced the ECB to
ease again and again over the past eight years. Rather, national governments
continued making promises they never delivered on, while failing to move
beyond their differences to make the monetary union more resilient and
efficient. It is the failure of politicians to take over
that has left the ECB on the hook.

Meanwhile EU 5Y5Y hitting new low.

> Use of the flag of Switzerland is restricted to companies
affiliated with the Swiss government; surprising legal
counsel didn't catch problem with graphic.

Also, for the question "What problem does this solve?", Kaminska simply
pointed answered:

> The problem of diminishing revenues from advertising in the wake of all the privacy crises
