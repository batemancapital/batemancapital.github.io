> Compared with our expectations in December, risks to the inflation outlook
> are tilted to the upside, particularly in the near term. If price pressures
> feed through into higher than anticipated wage rises or the economy returns
> more quickly to full capacity, inflation could turn out to be higher.

> in particular, we will carefully examine how higher energy prices will
> transmit through the economy and affect the outlook overall. Two channels
> could be at play, pulling inflation dynamics in different directions. On the
> one hand, rising energy costs can drive up prices directly, by increasing the
> cost of production, as well as indirectly, by having second-round effects on
> wages. On the other hand, they can have a negative impact on the incomes of
> households and the earnings of companies, thereby reducing economic activity
> and dampening the inflation outlook. In the past, the euro area has been
> particularly vulnerable to the second channel, as surges in energy prices
> weakened the spending power of households, and reduced inflation over the
> medium term.

NIRP is over.


> What we've learnt over time is that high inflation is now expected to stay
> there longer. We've had two strong inflation surprises in both December and
> in January, which makes a reassessment of the inflation outlook necessary. In
> particular, it now looks increasingly unlikely that inflation is going to
> drop below 2 per cent by the end of this year, as we had expected earlier.

> All of this implies that it has become increasingly likely that inflation is
> going to stabilise around our 2 per cent target over the medium term. This
> means that we should start thinking about a gradual normalisation of our
> policy.

> So I think we cannot simply look through everything, especially if inflation

[Lane: Inflation in the near-term and the medium-term](

> Moving from near-term to medium-term inflation dynamics, there is a clear
> potential linkage: if currently-high inflation causes a rethink about the
> likely level of medium-term inflation, a persistent shift in inflation
> expectations can play a significant role in determining inflation dynamics.

> The currently-high inflation rate calls this into question this conjecture
> through a stark demonstration that inflation is not destined to be always
> super low.

>  there are several factors indicating that the excessively-low inflation
>  environment that prevailed from 2014 to2019 (a period over which inflation
>  averaged just 0.9 per cent) might not re-emerge even after the pandemic
>  cycle is over.

> in particular, if the medium-term inflation dynamic is anticipated to
> stabilise around the two per cent target, this will permit a gradual
> normalisation of monetary policy. Whereas if inflation threatens to persist
> significantly above the two per cent target over the medium term, a
> tightening of monetary policy will be required. And finally, if inflation is
> anticipated to fall significantly below the two percent target over the
> medium term, setting an accommodative monetary policy will be necessary.

Villeroy (GC member):

> Today, in my personal judgement, it might be considered that the first
> criteria (with a headline inflation significantly above 2% since summer last
> year and expected to remain there for months ahead), and the third one (with
> underlying inflation around or above 2% by most definitions) are fulfilled.

> It is prudent to explore whether there is a role for a CBDC to preserve some
> of the safe and effective elements of the financial system of the present in
