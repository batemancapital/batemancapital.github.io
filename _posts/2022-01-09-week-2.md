[Fed: Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, December 14-15, 2021](
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220105a.htm)

December FOMC minutes out.

It's a bit on the surprising hawkish side that Fed was already discussing
balance sheet normalization.

Increasing QE reduction pace was under discussion.

> Participants judged that it would be appropriate to double the pace of the
> ongoing reduction in net asset purchases. Such a change would result in
> reducing the monthly pace of net purchases of Treasury securities by $20
> billion and of agency MBS by $10 billion starting in January. Participants
> also expected that economic con- ditions would evolve in a manner such that
> similar re- ductions in the pace of net asset purchases would be ap-
> propriate each subsequent month, resulting in an end to net asset purchases
> in mid-March, a few months sooner than participants had anticipated at the
> November FOMC meeting.

The rate of MonPol change is surprising. FOMC started tapering last Nov, but now
it already started discussing QT/BS runoff after deciding to do faster tapering.
And *earlier* and *faster* BS runoff.

> a significant amount of balance sheet shrinkage could be appropriate over the normalization process

> ... the appropriate timing of balance sheet runoff would likely be closer to that of policy rate liftoff than in the Committee’s previous experience

> They noted that current conditions included a stronger economic outlook, higher inflation, and a larger balance sheet and thus could warrant a potentially faster pace of policy rate normalization.

Fed is clearly spooked by spot inf. And they got the "nudge" from politicians.
