FOMC meeting this week. Fed gives no clear signal on if it will increase
asset purchase pace.

[Fed: Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference November 5, 2020](

Some highlights from FOMC press conference:

> (Powell) I will say that the support provided by the CARES Act was absolutely
essential in supporting the recovery that we've seen so far, which
has generally exceeded expectations. And I do think it's likely that
further support is likely to be needed for monetary policy. And fiscal policy,
I just mentioned the two risks that I think we face, and those would be
well-addressed through more fiscal policy. One is the further spread of the
virus, and the other is the lapsing of the CARES Act benefits and the
savings on people's balance sheets that will dwindle.

> (Powell) And I think I just would say that I think we'll have a stronger recovery if we can just get at least
some more fiscal support when it's appropriate, you know, when it's appropriate and the size
Congress thinks it's appropriate. I do think that that will likely -- and, by the way, you see, you
know, a lot of discussion on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Hill that suggests
generally that there will be something.

> (Powell): You know, we've gotten through the first five, six months of the expansion better than expected, but we do see in
Europe. You look at—look what's happening in Europe. Look what's happening here, another
spike in cases as the cold weather arrives and people are inside more. So I think we have to be
humble about where we are relative to this disease. It hasn't gone away. Clearly, you know,
therapeutics are advancing. Research on vaccines are advancing. Death rates are way down.
Hospitalization rates are lower now. But—so we're learning. But, I mean, we are so—we're very
far from saying that we think we've got this and eliminated the tail risks. But I think clearly the
tail risks have diminished since—at least our perception of them has diminished since earlier in
the year.
