[Federal Reserve System: New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review](

Powell gave review on Fed new monetary policy framework at Jackson Hole virtual meeting.

> The persistent undershoot of inflation from our 2 percent longer-run
> objective is a cause for concern. Many find it counterintuitive that the Fed
> would want to push up inflation. After all, low and stable inflation is
> essential for a well-functioning economy. And we are certainly mindful that
> higher prices for essential items, such as food, gasoline, and shelter, add
> to the burdens faced by many families, especially those struggling with lost
> jobs and incomes. However, inflation that is persistently too low can pose
> serious risks to the economy. Inflation that runs below its desired level can
> lead to an unwelcome fall in longer-term inflation expectations, which, in
> turn, can pull actual inflation even lower, resulting in an adverse cycle of
> ever-lower inflation and inflation expectations.

Fed pushes inflation overshoot, claiming persistent low inflation could
lead to deflation spiral.

US 10Y yield went higher after the speech.

Average Inflation Targeting shows up in new policy framework as expected.

> That augurs well for asset inflation, just not for prices.

Abenomics, negated by recent tax increase, did not really increase
inflation breakeven. Fed should also learn from other country's lession
that deflationary force could remain because of technology development
and ageing demography. However, when Fed desperatly pumps up inflation, it is
more possible that asset price will increase but not price inflation, just
like the past decade.
