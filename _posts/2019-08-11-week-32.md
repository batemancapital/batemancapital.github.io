It is very common nowadays to see op-ed predicting recession. Also, such
observation is quite prevalent as well, probably since GFC:

> You cannot solve the problems of debt with more debt. 

I agree with [one FT commentator](https://on.ft.com/2P6POc3) that one needs to understand his
position: trader and investor have different perspectives and goals.

> For investors the questions are different. Do I have enough liquidity to
avoid being a forced seller? Do I have enough excess liquidity to take
advantage of falling asset prices in the down turn and be a winner in
the upturn
