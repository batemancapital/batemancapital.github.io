> “The reality is that there is a huge section of this country that feels like
DC is filled with a bunch of self-serving careerists who’ve never built
anything in their lives, and that Wall Street is filled with people making
ungodly amounts of money, and Silicon Valley is just totally disconnected
from everyone, and all of them are trying to tell me how to live my life,” he says. 

These words remind me of one talk by Lloyd Blankfein I went to. Blankfein
said he is a market guy. When something happened, he starts from the market
to understand why. Then his words can be summarized basically into
"it is the same for politics. People who live in Bay or New York City could
not believe Donald Trump's success at 2016 election and most of them probably
do not know anyone who voted Trump or anyone who knows anyone who voted Trump.
But guess what, he was elected. Maybe we should start from the election result
to understand better this country".

[FT Alphaville: Why wordcrime has destroyed the economy](
https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2019/02/22/1550838206000/Why-wordcrime-has-destroyed-the-economy/)

FT Alphaville editor Izabella Kaminska[^1] talks about what the terms "Economy"
and "Economy Activity" are interpreted by the crowd nowadays:

> The phenomenon of the modern economic crisis, however, consists of the
world abruptly discovering that the surpluses we thought we had — and in many
cases pre-emptively consumed — don't really exist. And the reason they don't
exist is because the new modes of industry or technology we deployed
(and convinced ourselves were economic) were in fact not economic after all.

I think it is worthwhile to examine this observation under the ZIRP policy
created by QEs. Historical low interest rates created business that
will not survive in a market with normal interest rates. These businesses do
not participate in meaningful economic activity and created an illusion of
economy boom to some extent. [WEF's summary](#wef) of QE above talks about lessons
on income inequality.[^2] Its point can relate to Kaminska's critique of "economic activity":

> Giving some people more nice things by taking them away from other
people has become analogous with economic activity.

Early data shows stimulation is not very effective.

[FT: Chinese premier in rare spat with central bank](
https://www.ft.com/content/d8c1630a-35aa-11e9-bd3a-8b2a211d90d5)

Unexpected rational analysis by Premier Li:

> The increase in total social financing appears rather large on the surface,
but if one analyses in detail, a large part of this rise was bill financing
and short-term lending. Not only does this potentially create ‘arbitrage’
and ‘empty cycling’ of funds, but it may also bring new potential risks

## Fed
[ZH: Why Today's Fed's Minutes Release May Result In Brief Market Chaos](
https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-02-20/why-todays-feds-minutes-release-may-result-brief-market-chaos)

[FOMC: Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee](
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20190130.htm)

> "Almost all participants thought that it would be desirable to announce
before too long a plan to stop reducing the Federal Reserve's asset holdings later this year."

I think at this stage Fed decision to stop unwinding balance sheet is basically another QE. 
Some long option strategy on gold could be great.

#### Fed Educational Tools

* [Fed: Origins and Mission of the Federal Reserve](
https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/educational-tools/lecture-series-origins-and-mission.htm)

* [Fed: The Federal Reserve after World War II](
https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/educational-tools/lecture-series-the-federal-reserve-after-world-war-II.htm)

* [Fed: The Federal Reserve's Response to the Financial Crisis](

* [Fed: The Aftermath of the Crisis](
https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/educational-tools/lecture-series-the-aftermath-of-the-crisis.htm)

I was expecting Fed education materials can provide some interesting insights into
how Fed system works but everything in their slides are quite dull. In particular, I thought
their last series "The Aftermath of the Crisis" will talk extensively about the damage
QEs can bring, but there was none.

Buffett bashing gold in his latest annual letter:

> And what would that supposed protection have delivered? You would now have an asset worth about $4,200,
less than 1% of what would have been realized from a simple unmanaged investment in American business. The
magical metal was no match for the American mettle.
