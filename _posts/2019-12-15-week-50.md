> Mr. Powell, the first Fed chairman without a Ph.D. in economics in
three decades, doesn’t always come to big issues with a firm view but
instead waits to hear what everyone says first. Some staffers have traced
certain intellectual curiosities to economic debates he has been
following on Twitter. He doesn’t tweet.

Personally, I think this is better than Ph.D. Fed chairs who are deep
into academic economy theory.

Mike Bird from WSJ [tweets](https://twitter.com/Birdyword/status/1204615967667441665):

> Hot take: I'd rather have a lawyer with an interest in economic policy who
was reading econ twitter  in charge of the Fed than a PhD economist who wasn't.
