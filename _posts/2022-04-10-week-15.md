[Lael Brainard: Variation in the Inflation Experiences of Households](
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20220405a.htm)

Volcker quote to start the speech

> Forty years ago, Paul Volcker noted that the dual mandate isn't an either-or
> proposition and that runaway inflation "would be the greatest threat to the
> continuing growth of the economy… and ultimately, to employment."

> Today, inflation is very high, particularly for food and gasoline. All
> Americans are confronting higher prices, but the burden is particularly great
> for households with more limited resources. 

> Given that the recovery has been considerably stronger and faster than in the
> previous cycle, I expect the balance sheet to shrink considerably more
> rapidly than in the previous recovery, with significantly larger caps and a
> much shorter period to phase in the maximum caps compared with 2017–19. 

Forward guidance seems working as expected

> Our communications have resulted in broad market expectations for an
> expeditious increase in the policy rate toward a neutral level and a more
> rapid reduction in the balance sheet compared with 2017–19. Consistent with
> these expectations, we have already seen significant tightening in market
> financing conditions at longer maturities, which tend to be most relevant for
> household and business decisionmaking. For instance, 30-year mortgage rates
> have increased more than 100 basis points in just a few months and are now at
> levels last seen in late 2018.
