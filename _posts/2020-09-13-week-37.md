[Greenlight Capital: Q2 update](
https://valuewalkpremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Qlet2020-02-1.pdf)

> All that said, as we studied the various ways to profit from higher inflation, we settled on
the most direct method – betting on unexpected increases in the U.S. Consumer Price Index
(CPI). 

Greenlight directly bets on inflation expectation rebound using swap.

> In theory, higher inflation creates higher long-term interest rates and lower Treasury prices.
However, we do not believe that shorting Treasuries is nearly as attractive as inflation swaps,
as Treasury prices no longer reflect a free-market price. Not only has the Federal Reserve
(the Fed) directly entered the Treasury market with large purchases, it has further announced
it will “study” yield curve control (YCC). Speculating on materially lower bond prices is
now a tougher call, as the market knows that the Fed is considering YCC. To wit, since the
March lows, 10-year inflation expectations have risen an entire 1% without any move in 10-
year Treasuries.
