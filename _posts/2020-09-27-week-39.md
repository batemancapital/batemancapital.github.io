Powell:

> The power of fiscal policy is really unequaled by anything else.

[Congressional Budget Office: The 2020 Long-Term Budget Outlook](
https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56598)

> By the end of 2020, federal debt held by the public is projected to equal 98
> percent of GDP. The projected budget deficits would boost federal debt to 104
> percent of GDP in 2021, to 107 percent of GDP (the highest amount in the
> nation’s history) in 2023, and to 195 percent of GDP by 2050.

Imagine how low 10-year yield will be.

### Debt and Credit

[WSJ: No Job, Loads of Debt: Covid Upends Middle-Class Family Finances](

> In a good year, the 43-year-old lawyer and her husband, Ian Boschen, 41,
> together brought in about $175,000, the couple said—enough to cover the
> mortgage, two car leases, student loans, credit cards and assorted costs of
> raising two daughters in the New York City suburbs.

> After the coronavirus halted many foreclosures and closed courts, her work
> dried up. Unemployment benefits have helped, Ms. Hopkins said, but the family
> is running low on savings and can’t keep up with $9,000 in monthly debt
> payments including mortgage installments. 

> Lynn Scott-White, 47, was furloughed from her job as a corporate travel agent
> at the end of March. Before the pandemic, she and her husband together earned
> roughly $150,000, she said.

> The Denton, Texas, couple pay $4,400 a month on their mortgage, four car loans
> and leases, and student debt, 

It is quite amazing how much debt American middle-class families are willing to take.
