[Jacobin: I Hate New Year’s Day](
http://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/01/antonio-gramsci-new-years-day/)

> That’s why I hate New Year’s. I want every morning to be a new year’s for me. Every day I want to reckon with myself, and every day I want to renew myself. No day set aside for rest. I choose my pauses myself, when I feel drunk with the intensity of life and I want to plunge into animality to draw from it new vigor.
