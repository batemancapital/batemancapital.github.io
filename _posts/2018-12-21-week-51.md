[London today, Tangier tomorrow, by train!](https://www.seat61.com/Morocco.htm)

[Bob Harper: Sequentiality as the Essence of Parallelism](https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2017/11/04/sequentiality-is-the-essence-of-parallelism/)

Second time I read this and I still don't want to read PFPL.

[There is no Fork: an Abstraction for Efficient,
Concurrent, and Concise Data Access](https://simonmar.github.io/bib/papers/haxl-icfp14.pdf)

Core idea is basically the above blog post, but more on the engineering aspect

[Roger Ebert: Last Tango in Paris, Roger Ebert review](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/last-tango-in-paris-1972)

> The movie frightened off imitators, and instead of being the first of many X-rated films dealing honestly with sexuality, it became almost the last. Hollywood made a quick U-turn into movies about teenagers, technology, action heroes and special effects.

The best movie review I have read this year.
