[Federal Reserve: Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee](
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20201216.htm)

FOMC participants: short-term risk still exist, medium-term risk turning lower:

> Participants noted that, with the pandemic worsening across the country, the
expansion would likely slow in coming months. In contrast, for the medium
term, participants commented that positive vaccine news had improved the economic outlook. 

More emphasis on *qualitative* and *outcome-based* guidance:

> All participants supported enhancing the Committee’s guidance on asset
purchases at this meeting and, in par- ticular, adopting qualitative,
outcome-based guidance in- dicating that increases in asset holdings would continue

Some participants mentioned purchasing longer-duration Treasuries or
increasing asset purchase pace:

> all participants judged that it would be appropriate to continue those
purchases at least at the current pace, and nearly all favored main- taining
the current composition of purchases, although a couple of participants indicated
that they were open to weighting purchases of Treasury securities toward
longer maturities. Participants generally judged that the asset purchase program
as structured was providing very significant policy accommodation. Some participants
noted that the Committee could consider future adjust- ments to its asset purchases
—such as increasing the pace of securities purchases or weighting purchases of
Treasury securities toward those that had longer remaining maturities if such
adjustments were deemed appropri- ate to support the attainment of the Committee’s objec- tives.
