## Miscellaneous

[FT How to Spend It: The tantalising tastes of Taipei](
https://howtospendit.ft.com/travel/206225-the-tantalising-tastes-of-taipei)

It is always a lot fun reading FT's How to Spend it. Is this peak how-to-spend-it level?

> As I carelessly spear chunks of the rare flesh and meditate on the joyous
nature of alfresco eating in a city that seems addicted to food, the juices
drip down another blameless shirt. My laundry bill, it occurs to me,
will almost certainly be higher than my food bill

[FT: The anti-social secret of success](
https://www.ft.com/content/4807b2a2-7c76-11e9-81d2-f785092ab560)

> The worst marriages I know of were entered into by people who had tired of — who feared — being alone.

I always hope this is true since I was young.

> No, what companionship really compromises is work. Being alone and
feeling lonely are not the same thing, but each can be a spur to high achievement.

Certainly can correlate.
