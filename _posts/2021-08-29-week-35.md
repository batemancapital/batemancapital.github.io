[Federal Reserve: Monetary Policy in the Time of COVID](

J Pow delivered his J Hole speech.

>  My view is that the "substantial further progress" test has been met for inflation. There has also been clear progress toward maximum employment. 

> The intervening month has brought more progress in the form of a strong employment report for July, but also the further spread of the Delta variant. We will be carefully assessing incoming data and the evolving risks. 

"Clear progress" has been made toward maximum employment. It seems like
if August and September job numbers come out good, taper will start in November
or December.

> The timing and pace of the coming reduction in asset purchases will not be intended to carry a direct signal regarding the timing of interest rate liftoff, for which we have articulated a different and substantially more stringent test. 

J Pow clearly delinked tapering path with rate path.
