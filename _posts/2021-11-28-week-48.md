More "inflation!" headlines

[Fed: Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, November 2-3, 2021](
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20211103.pdf)

> Some participants preferred a somewhat faster pace of reductions that would
> result in an earlier conclusion to net purchases.

> Some participants suggested that reducing the pace of net asset purchases by
> more than $15 billion each month could be warranted so that the Committee
> would be in a better position to make adjustments to the target range for the
> federal funds rate, particularly in light of inflation pressures. Various
> participants noted that the Committee should be prepared to adjust the pace
> of asset purchases and raise the target range for the federal funds rate
> sooner than participants currently anticipated if inflation continued to run
> higher than levels consistent with the Committee’s objectives.

> The surge in house prices has made gains in wealth more broad-based, Swonk
> says, adding: “You can sell, borrow against [property] or trade down into a
> condo — the ability to do that was absent before. In 2008/09, you would have
> been underwater.”

[FT Opinion (John Dizard): Central banks are stuck in a ‘hall of mirrors’](
https://www.ft.com/content/970dbfd2-681a-4fb2-b074-91b1e032838e)

> In other words, by staring at the reflections of their own policies of the
> recent past, the central banks have kept official rates too low for too long,
> and their communication of their expectations has depressed long-term saving
> and investment in the private sector.

> Unproductive activity was unintentionally encouraged. Setting low rates for
> too long led to overpriced housing, too little class or labour mobility and
> the growth of leveraged speculation.
