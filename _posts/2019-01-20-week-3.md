simple and efficient.

[Market Impact Models](
https://www.quantopian.com/lectures/market-impact-models)

OHLC pricing data to get windowed volatility data fast.

Also need careful study of how market, volatility in particular, impacts strategy
execution. After all, simulating strategy in program has limited fun.

minutely market data. As far as I know, minutely data is only available for free
on Quantopian.
