> “Feels so unreal and permanent at the same time. This cycle has been so
> long & slow that the crazy seeped in gently. ’99-00 was nuts and all knew
> it; ’08 was obviously a train wreck. This one feels WEIRD – no
> rules, no reality, no gravity. For now.”

> First, the sense of a “permanently high plateau” has marked every bubble
> extreme in history. Yet if one studies (or lived through) the market extremes
> in 1929, 2000, and 2007, there was a general sense – occasionally expressed
> but then immediately dismissed – that the markets were extreme, accompanied
> by various arguments – like Irving Fisher’s – that the elevated valuations
> were “justified” by one thing or another. It was only in hindsight, after
> those bubbles collapsed, that the preceding speculative episodes were
> commonly understood as “nuts.”
