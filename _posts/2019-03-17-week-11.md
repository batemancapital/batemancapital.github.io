> As for any notion that Fed policy has elevated asset prices and left behind
those without the means to benefit, circumstances that have skewed both wealth
and income inequality, Pelley asked, “Where are we headed in this country in
terms of income disparity?” Echoing his predecessors, Powell replied, “Well,
the Fed doesn’t have direct responsibility for these issues.”

## China

[FT: The Great Firewall of China — web of control](
https://www.ft.com/content/e19b3022-40eb-11e9-9bee-efab61506f44)

There is nothing new. I often find major western medias' coverage of
The Great Firewall dull and out-of-date.

mechanisms, financial and economic system reactions and long-term
consequences. The world is in completely uncharted territory.

[PIMCO: Income Fund Update: Navigating Late‑Cycle Markets](
https://www.pimco.com/en-us/insights/investment-strategies/strategy-spotlight/income-fund-update-navigating-late-cycle-markets)

I am very interested in $PIMIX's impressive return in the past ten years (almost
beating $SPY). I am surprised to find out its turnover is 266%, meaning it is
under very active management. I would like to understand more about its strategy (which is
probably its only aspect I can learn about as it is impossible to acquire its credit
quality breakdown). This interview of its manager Daniel J. Ivascyn gives 
a good overview of PIMIX's strategy in 2019. Ivascyn's view of global economy
is also worth a read.

[Portfolio Visualizer: PIMIX v.s. SPY](
https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/fund-performance?s=y&symbol=PIMIX&benchmark=SPY&endDate=03%2F13%2F2019)

PIMIX outperforms SPY since 2007, with higher Sharpe/Sortino ratio.

[FT: Palladium has the catalysts to extend record run](
https://www.ft.com/content/b2840800-44af-11e9-a965-23d669740bfb)

with Palladium hitting new high, there is still bullish view, but:

more obscure.

Just learnt more about Bill Gross this week. It seems PIMCO is as legendary
as Vanguard but on the bond and fixed income side.

https://www.ft.com/content/31122ca4-4444-11e9-a965-23d669740bfb)

Hudson Yards certainly looks like where future New York elites hang out. I
am not sure if there is anything interesting there to me, except a few public
place (e.g. Vessel).

FT is at it again, but I have to admit it is a good guide if you want to purchase
some high-quality shirts.

When talking about GS with friend, I recalled a fabulous article about Goldman
and Lloyd written by Sunday Times. It is kind of hilarious so I had fun reading it again.

FT Alphaville's Izabella Kaminska had a podcast with Andrew Keen talking about
digital economy. I certainly agree Jeff Bezos is the biggest Bond villain.
