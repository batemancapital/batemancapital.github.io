[FT Opinion (Gillian Tett): A deadly disease, globalisation and me](
https://www.ft.com/content/a52b7f48-633b-11ea-a6cd-df28cc3c6a68)

Gillian Tett is such a talented storyteller.

> I learnt one more lesson in Singapore: westerners tend to be far too
complacent about the future. If you live in professional circles in
the more comfortable corners of America, Europe and modernised Asia,
it feels normal to extrapolate what will happen in the coming years based on the recent past.

> Hence the fact that bankers sell 10-, 20- or 100-year bonds, and we tell our
children to plan long-term careers. Being rich confers a confidence to our prediction-making.

Cannot agree anymore. Cognitive bias at work.
