https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-some-in-japan-another-day-older-and-deeper-in-debt-doesnt-sound-so-bad-11553947202)

Evidence of long-term ZIRP distorting market:

> But the negative side effects of the Abe-Kuroda strategy are starting
to pile up as investors and lenders increasingly struggle to cope with zero
interest rates. Rock-bottom rates help sustain unproductive companies by
shielding them from market forces. They also diminish the capacity of weak
banks to absorb losses, especially regional institutions without nationwide networks.

> For fiscal policy to be properly implemented, we need market discipline to
fully function ... but because the BOJ is flattening yields, that function
is constrained.
