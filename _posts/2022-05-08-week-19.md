Hawkish tone from Schnabel could lead some rethink at Governing Council.

On inflation:

>  Core inflation, which excludes energy and food, climbed strongly to 3.5 per
>  cent. So, we are seeing that inflationary pressures are becoming more
>  broad-based.

On wage/wage-price spiral:

> At present I don’t see such a spiral whereby rising wages create rising
> prices and vice versa. **However, the data are backward-looking** and we need to
> pursue a forward-looking monetary policy. So we can’t afford to wait until a
> wage-price spiral has already set in before responding.

> We need to prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched in expectations.
> Talking is no longer enough, we need to act.

On rate timing:

> I believe that we will be able to end net purchases under our regular asset
> purchase programme, or APP, at the end of June.


> From today’s perspective, a rate increase in July is possible in my view.

Speficailly on rate destination.

> We are starting from an extremely low level. Real interest rates are still
> deeply negative and close to their historical lows. That means that even
> after the first increases, interest rates will remain at levels that continue
> supporting the economy. We are still quite far off from a neutral interest
> rate, that is the point as of which the economy is slowed.

On rate increase pace. This feels fairly hawkish.

> The lowering of interest rates below zero was uncharted territory, making it
> essential to move cautiously. This reasoning does not apply when moving in
> the opposite direction.

> “Labour demand is very strong, and while labour force participation has
> increased somewhat, labour supply remains subdued,” said Fed chair Jay Powell
> during his post-meeting press conference this week. “Employers are having
> difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at the fastest pace
> in many years.”

> Furthermore, a large fall in house prices would significantly reduce housing
> wealth and could lead to a contraction in consumer spending, especially when
> combined with borrowers cutting back discretionary spending due to rising interest
> rates and higher living costs.
