### Central Banks / Economy

[ZH: Negative Interest Rates Are The Price We Pay For De-Civilization](
https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/negative-interest-rates-are-price-we-pay-de-civilization)

The most concise explanation of NIRP I have read so far. I wish author
go further on his point of "capital destruction" / "de-civilization".

[FT: Lack of red flags suggests recession a way off yet](
https://www.ft.com/content/c4294876-daf1-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17)

[PIMCO: Window of Weakness](

https://www.ft.com/content/dba9f10a-e125-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc)

[WSJ: ‘Why Were They Surprised?’ Repo Market Turmoil Tests New York Fed Chief](
https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-were-they-surprised-repo-market-turmoil-tests-new-york-fed-chief-11569777702)

[FT: Draghi backs calls for fiscal union to bolster eurozone](
https://www.ft.com/content/1d702afe-e2ad-11e9-b112-9624ec9edc59)

ECB calling for fiscal policy as monetary policy has its limit.

[FT Alphaville: When risky zero-sum behaviours prop-up growth](
https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2019/09/27/1569579721000/When-risky-zero-sum-behaviours--prop-up-growth/)

Another great read from Kaminska.

> Moreover, as people responded to the new financial pressures, they
caused still more balance sheet expansion as they increasingly speculated on
asset prices and made or took out risky loans. Thus, risky decisions in
each business cycle contributed to balance sheet growth, which increased
the pressures for excessive risk taking in the next business cycle—and
the process is still in effect.

Economy fuelled by nonstop balance sheet growth always introduces
significant risk. The bubble will eventually pop.

### Debt and Credit

[FT: Global debt surges to highest level in peacetime](
https://www.ft.com/content/661f5c8a-dec9-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc)

This article relates well to the book [This Time is Different](
https://books.google.com/books/about/This_Time_Is_Different.html?id=Iihe6s0XincC&source=kp_book_description):

> If there is one common theme to the vast range of crises we consider
in this book, it is that excessive debt accumulation, whether it is by
the government, banks, corporations, or consumers, often poses greater
systemic risks than it seems during a boom.

[WSJ: Eyeing That Sweater? It’s Yours in Four Easy Payments](
https://www.wsj.com/articles/eyeing-that-sweater-its-yours-in-four-easy-payments-11569672000)

Load is a form of violence.

### Trading and Investment

[FT Opinion (Robin Wigglesworth): Why the index fund ‘bubble’ should be applauded](
https://www.ft.com/content/c463f8c8-dde8-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc)

[WSJ: Citadel’s Griffin Reaps Windfall From Company’s Bond Sale](
https://wsj.com/articles/citadels-griffin-reaps-windfall-from-companys-bond-sale-11569262332)

[FT Opinion (Leo Lewis): Burry of ‘The Big Short’ has a risky new ‘value’ bet on Japan](
https://www.ft.com/content/1ec5bc2e-df84-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc)

[Harley Bassman: The Opposite of Bad is Worse](
http://convexitymaven.com/images/Convexity_Maven_-_The_Opposite_of_Bad_is_Worse.pdf)

> The BOJ owns about 43% of Government bonds (JGB) issued and nearly
77% of the ETF market. There is little doubt they will expand these
programs, perhaps to include buying single name equities. Such an expansion
of liquidity will surely increase the nominal price of the NKY.

[WSJ: Goldman Sachs Tries Banking for the Masses. It’s Been a Struggle.](
https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachs-tries-banking-for-the-masses-its-been-a-struggle-11569643252)

> Marcus acquired four tech startups including Clarity Money, a personal-finance
app whose founder, Adam Dell, zipped around Goldman’s headquarters on
a hoverboard until it was confiscated by legal staff after someone
crashed it, people familiar with the matter said.

The article also gives me a feeling that head of investment banking does not
have much bargain power against head of tech industry.

[FT Opinion (Rana Foroohar): Are investors ready for the ‘Doomsday Dollar’ scenario?](
https://www.ft.com/content/e780bee4-e03c-11e9-b112-9624ec9edc59)

> What if the entire paradigm for long-term investing was to change?

This is also the question I think about often. What if USD gets weaker
and USD debt yield increases in the next decade? What if US gradually loses
its dominant status in the world? Of course, those Bogleehads will be
anti-intellectual enough to ignore such question.

[FT Editorial Board: China’s long march to national rejuvenation](
https://www.ft.com/content/d45119de-e11f-11e9-b112-9624ec9edc59)

One commentator:

> It is sadder when you have been using the same arguments each time, without
any progress in the theories or any sense on what really happened
in that authoritarian country at all.

FT Editorial Board cannot be free from this problem either.
