Powell seems serious. Also, this means two hawkish dots are removed.

[Fed (Lael Brainard): Navigating Delta Headwinds on the Path to a Full Recovery](

Brainard made a super dovish speech.

> The economy continues to make welcome progress, but the Delta variant has been more disruptive than initially expected

> While the headline unemployment rate declined to 5.2 percent in August, the unemployment rate adjusted for COVID-related nonparticipation remained elevated at 7.5 percent.5 The employment-to-population (EPOP) ratio for prime-age workers stood at 78 percent in Augustâ€”2.4 percentage points below its pre-COVID level.

> So overall, the labor market is making progress, although at a slower pace than earlier in the year

> In contrast, the labor force participation rate of 61.7 percent in August has shown little progress so far. Some observers argue that labor force participation has moved permanently lower, and the labor market is already tight, such that we should not expect a return to pre-COVID employment conditions. But the decline in labor force participation appears to reflect COVID-related constraints that have been prolonged by Delta rather than permanent structural changes in the economy.

>  I would emphasize that no signal about the timing of liftoff should be taken from any decision to announce a slowing of asset purchases
