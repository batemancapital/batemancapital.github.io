[Fed: Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement](

July FOMC statement out.

Nick Timiraos from WSJ:

> The Fed upgraded its assessment of the economy and downgraded its assessment of virus risks.

 Also, Fed sees economy has made good progress and is on track of reaching "substantial further progress". The path to tapering looks clearer now.

Powell when being asked about "transitory": "if it doesn't affect longer-term
inflation expectations, then it's very likely to not affect the process of inflation going forward"

Also, Powell said it's unlikely Fed will reduce MBS purchase before reducing Treasury purchase.

[Fed:
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20210730a.htm

>  I am particularly attentive to any signs that currently high inflation readings are
pushing longer-term inflation expectations above our 2 percent objective. Currently, I do not see such signs.

Risk is balanced:

> There are risks on both sides of the outlook. There are upside risks to
consumption spending associated with the high level of households' savings. There are downside risks associated with the Delta variant. 

More evidences are needed for "substantial further progress".

> The determination of when to begin to slow asset purchases will depend importantly on the accumulation
of evidence that substantial further progress on employment has been achieved. As of today, employment has some distance to go.

emphasize that QE path is not linked with rate path

> It is important to emphasize that the achievement of substantial progress that will determine
when the Committee starts reducing the pace of asset purchases is distinct from the maximum
employment and inflation outcomes that are in the forward guidance for the policy rate.

Also good comment [from Paul A. Myers](https://www.ft.com/content/bb2bd452-727f-4fe4-877c-4d0875c187d3?commentID=adbcc496-8e88-4a00-ac4f-9fde1ec07869):

> The weak point of the dollar being the global currency is that its future
value is tethered to the ability of the US government to tax funds away from
the US economy, not the global economy where the dollar does so much of its work.
So narrowness of the future funding base is one vulnerability: an international
reserve asset backed by one national economy. Possibly the Federal Reserve should
consider holding international sovereign debt among its assets.

Certainly I do not know this:

> At this point it is perhaps worth deflating the notion that nothing like this
ever happens in America. Some of you will remember when President Barack Obama
took on the American for-profit college sector, passing the “gainful employment”
rule. It took away eligibility for government education loans from schools whose
graduates did not land well-paying jobs. The sector was decimated.

[JIN: Tweets](https://archive.is/Y8o9x)

Always love Dr.Jin's tweets.

The system becomes so complex that it's hard to find out what's going wrong in the system.
And it's exactly because of this that there is uncertainty in my understanding
of the system.

Jin's follow-up [analogy tweet](https://archive.is/tuiOb) is so funny.
