https://twitter.com/DeItaOne/status/1096042586844876800)

No Fed rate hike this year? It seems Fed is turning dovish and will stop unwinding
its balance sheet. Why so if U.S economy is doing well? What will happen
if Fed keeps QE? Fed dovish tone should be good news to gold in medium term.

> Mining companies that hedge their production are locked into a delivery price and are not subject to 
the fluctuations of the price of gold. If we believe that the price of gold will be higher in the 
future and we do, then we want the exposure to those price fluctuations as they will result in higher 
stock prices.
