[FT: Jay Powell says ‘room to build’ on US economic expansion](

> Mr Powell also said while the people he talked with at the Fed’s public
events were focused on the rising costs of medical care and housing, he
was worried that the possibility of inflation expectations — predictions
among households and businesses of what prices increases will be in the
future — would continue to drop, dragging down actual inflation,
and with it interest rates.

Fed policy in essence: ignore elevated asset price since GFC and care
most about inflation expectation.

In addition,

> two earlier investors in Oyo were Didi and Grab, the
ride-hailing companies backed by SoftBank. That raises the question
of whether money used to boost their valuations was then reused to
hike the value of another SoftBank investment.
