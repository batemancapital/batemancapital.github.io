[Governor Lael Brainard: Patience and Progress as the Economy Reopens and Recovers](

Some highlignts here:

> The outlook is bright, but uncertainty remains, and employment **and inflation** are far from our goals.

Another emphasis on outcome-based approach

> so basing monetary policy on outcomes rather than the outlook will serve us well.

> But today, by any measure, employment remains far from our goals. 

> The path of inflation is also difficult to predict, although **there are a variety of reasons to expect an increase in inflation associated with reopening that is largely transitory.**

> To the extent that supply chain congestion and other reopening frictions are transitory, they are unlikely to generate persistently higher inflation on their own.

> A limited period of pandemic-related price increases is unlikely to durably change inflation dynamics

Fed's new CIE is worth attention.

> The Index of Common Inflation Expectations moved back to 2 percent in the first quarter

> But recent experience suggests we should not lightly dismiss the risk on the other side.
Achieving our inflation goal requires firmly anchoring inflation expectations at 2 percent.
Following the reopening, **there will need to be strong underlying momentum to reach the outcomes in our forward guidance.**
