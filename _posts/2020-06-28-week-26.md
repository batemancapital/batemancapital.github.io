Recently I went through Fed FOMC press conference transcripts again and
found two of my favorite excerpts. 

[April FOMC press conference transcripts](https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20200429.pdf):

> CHAIR POWELL. So we think that low interest rates affect the economy through a
number of channels in a positive way. Lower interest rates support economic activity through
channels that we—overall, through channels that we understand reasonably well. They make it
cheaper to borrow, they make—they drive, you know, your costs of borrowing down. They
do—they do raise asset prices, including the value of your home. If your saver owns a home or
has a 401(k), your saver will benefit from that. But for people who are really, really just relying
on their bank savings account earnings, this is—you know, that’s—that’s—you’re not going to
benefit from low interest rates.

> But we—you know, we have to look out for the overall economy. Low interest rates
support employment, they support economic activity, and those are our mandates. And I think
for the overall good of the economy, low interest rates are a good thing. And that’s not to say
they’re good for every single person, but that shouldn’t stop us from doing what we think is—is
good for the whole.


[June FOMC press conference transcripts](https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20200610.pdf):

> I think our—our principal focus, though, is on—on the state of the economy and on the
labor market and on inflation. Now, inflation, of course, is—is low, and we think it’s very likely
to remain low for some time, below our target. So, really, it’s about getting the labor market
back and getting it in shape. That’s—that’s been our major focus. And I would say, you know,
we—if we were to hold back because—we would never do this, but—the idea that, just the
concept that we would hold back because we think asset prices are too high—others may not
think so, but we just decided that that’s the case—what would happen to those people? You
know, what would happen to the people that we’re actually legally supposed to be serving?
We’re supposed to be pursuing maximum employment and stable prices, and that’s what we’re
pursuing

People say Fed is the most powerful player in the market. However, they
often ignored Fed failed to achieve its inflation target in the past 10
years, with historical low unemployment rate. Rate market already priced
in low inflation in the next ten years. It is very possible Fed won't be happy
about the result of its inflation targeting work in the long future. The
next ten years could be a repeat of the past ten years.

I think it's better for Fed (along with fiscal side) change its future
strategy. Low rate leads more debt in the system but will it really bring
back inflation in an already heavily indebted system? Will people feel
confident about the high asset price in such environment?

Real rate should keep going down. This will be bullish to gold.
