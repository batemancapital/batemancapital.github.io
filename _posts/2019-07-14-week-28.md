> The US central bank may have an army of economists, sophisticated models
refined by generations of staffers and access to data that most hedge funds
can only dream of. But even the Fed’s brainpower is dwarfed by the collective
wisdom of millions of investors who shape the bond market, argues Jim Paulsen,
a strategist at the Leuthold Group.

Fed v.s. Market.

SGS inflation-adjusted gold price looks interesting, Also, the last paragraph
is peak ZeroHedge:

> So some of us took our positions in gold 17 years ago and many others later.
But since we are all holding gold for wealth protection reasons, we will be
“sitting” for many years to come without any concern about the value of our
gold holding. We know with absolute certainty that governments will continue
to oblige by destroying the economy, spending money their countries can’t
afford to spend, increasing deficits and debts, and totally debasing currencies
until they are worthless. For those reasons we are holding gold and sleeping well at night.
