Market waits the next move from the Fed. Of course Fed responds.

It seems we have entered a time in which not only the market participants
but the entire world economy rely more and more on central banks'
monetary policy. Central banks are viewed as omnipotent and can help with
everything: climate change, wealth inequality, and now virus epidemic (impact on
economy).

The last chapter of the book [This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly](
https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691152646/this-time-is-different) well
summarized this problem:

> “In the run-up to the recent crisis, in the case of rich countries one of the
> main this-time-is-different syndromes had to do with a belief in the
> invincibility of modern monetary institutions. Central banks became enamored
> with their own versions of “inflation targeting,” believing that they had
> found a way both to keep inflation low and to optimally stabilize output.
> Though their successes were founded on some solid institutional progress,
> especially the independence of the central banks, those successes seem to have
> been oversold. Policies that appeared to work perfectly well during an
> all-encompassing boom suddenly did not seem at all robust in the event of a
> huge recession. Market investors, in turn, relied on the central banks to bail
> them out in the event of any trouble. The famous “Greenspan put” (named after
> Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan) was based on the (empirically
> well-founded) belief that the U.S. central bank would resist raising interest
> rates in response to a sharp upward spike in asset prices (and therefore not
> undo them) but would react vigorously to any sharp fall in asset prices by
> cutting interest rates to prop them up. Thus, markets believed “the Federal
> Reserve provided investors with a one-way bet. That the Federal Reserve would
> resort to extraordinary measures once a collapse started has now been proven
> to be a fact. In hindsight, it is now clear that a single-minded focus on
> inflation can be justified only in an environment in which other regulators
> are able to ensure that leverage (borrowing) does not become excessive.

> The lesson of history, then, is that even as institutions and policy makers
> improve, there will always be a temptation to stretch the limits. Just as an
> individual can go bankrupt no matter how rich she starts out, a financial system
> can collapse under the pressure of greed, politics, and profits no matter how
> well regulated it seems to be.”
