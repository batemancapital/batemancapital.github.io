## Fed - Debt

Fed chairman Jay Powell at US Senate committee for two days this week.

[ZH: Watch Live: Fed Chair Powell Addresses Senate Banking Committee](
https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-02-26/watch-live-fed-chair-powell-addresses-senate-banking-committee)

Powell bashing MMT:

> The idea that deficits don’t matter for countries that can
borrow in their own currency I think is just wrong,

> The “U.S. debt is fairly high to the level of GDP -- and much more
importantly -- it’s growing faster than GDP, really significantly faster.
We are going to have to spend less or raise more revenue.

https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-02-25/friday-debt-ceiling-returns-and-treasury-runs-out-cash-6-months-later)

It is very clear that ZeroHedge articles always have a negative attitude
towards Fed system/fiat money system.

[FT: Fed aims to unveil plan to end balance sheet rundown ‘fairly soon’](
https://www.ft.com/content/83c1fdc2-3aa7-11e9-b856-5404d3811663)

Takeaway:
1. Fed may announce detailed plan about its balance sheet at March 19-20 meeting
2. Fed will not change its 2 percent inflation target

[ZH: Goldman: Fed To End Balance Sheet Runoff At End Of Q3; Will Make Announcement In March Meeting](
https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-02-27/fed-end-balance-sheet-runoff-end-q3-will-make-announcement-march-meeting-goldman)

> As a result, Goldman expects the Fed to maintain its current approach to
 MBS runoff as its base case in the near-term, even though eventual small
sales of MBS of roughly $3-$5bn per month are quite possible. At the same time,
Fed purchases of Treasury securities to replace MBS are likely to occur at
the front end of the curve, and in the secondary market where purchases to
replace other securities must occur.

> Finally, a consequence of this is that as some other analysts have
suggested, a deliberate shift toward shorter Treasury maturities is likely,
i.e. a reverse Operation Twist. This would provide the Fed greater
flexibility in a potential downturn to ease via maturity extension,
in the same vein of Operation Twist.

[FT: Federal Reserve nears decisions on its asset portfolio](
https://www.ft.com/content/14f833ee-3173-11e9-8744-e7016697f225)

To maintain its balance sheet, Fed could be buying short-term Treasuries.
FT commented this could put Fed in a position to reverse
tactic in case of recession and buy more longer-dated Treasuries, which
will be similar to Operation Twist.

Besides Fed fund rate, Fed has many other weapons in its arsenal.
More about [Operation Twist](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operation-twist.asp):

FT's coverage about Operation Twist back in 2011:

[FT Alphaville - Richard Woolnough: Untwist the Fed](
https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/04/26/1524745661000/Untwist-the-Fed/)

Woolnough discusses possible _Reverse Operation Twist_ in the future:

> The next phase of policy will involve less reliance on interest-rate hikes.
It will feature a more aggressive unwinding of QE, and a reversal of Operation
Twist. This unwind can be completed by reorganizing the Fed’s balance sheet
through the buying of shorter-dated securities and selling longer-dated
securities. This would have the benefit of removing duration risk from the
Fed’s balance sheet, and would steepen the yield curve.

[FT: Chinese consumers: your country needs you](

## Gold

[ZH: Why Warren Buffett Should Buy Gold](
https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-03-01/why-warren-buffett-should-buy-gold)

Totally agreed author's argument that gold is not investment. It is an
alternative currency and hedge against systematic turmoil. One should not
have zero gold or go all in gold.

[ZH: Where Do Things Stand In The Gold Market?](
https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-03-01/where-do-things-stand-gold-market)

Just like all the other people talking about gold on ZH, author does not
have much faith in central bank system. Most observations in the article
are nothing new if you read ZH often.

[Columbia Journalism Review - Amber A'Lee Frost: Why the Left Can’t Stand The New York Times](
https://www.cjr.org/special_report/why-the-left-cant-stand-the-new-york-times.php/)

One of the best essays I have read recently. I laughed hard first and then totally
understood author's arguments. I am not wasting time on NYT and I am a proud
FT reader.

> The paper’s collective decision to dedicate space—even in the infinite
arena of Web content—and resources to such utterly meaningless and
unnewsworthy trivialities indicates an editorial commitment not to journalism,
but to educated-middle-class dinner party talking points.

This article is quite ridiculous. I read the title first and thought
it was kidding. However at the very end this article provided some
listings and agents' contact info. FT did a good job establishing itself
as the most elite newspaper.
