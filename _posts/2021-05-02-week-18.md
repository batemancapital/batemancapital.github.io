### Central Banks / Economy

[FOMC Press Conference, Apr 28, 2021](
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33B4KyxX0v8)

Fed showed no sign of tapering (emphasis on *substantial further progress*),
mentioned the coming inflation reading should be transitory due to base effect.

Also J Pow gave great answer on recent China's CBDC first-move. I agree that
what backs the global reserve status of USD are the rule of law, 
democratic institution, economy, and open capital account. Also J Pow believes
China CBDC is more about the domestic financial system, rather than global
competition.

Overall good press conf. I like J Pow emphasized many times on
"substantial further progress" and mentioned "we've made very little progress".
The market move today showed that market was expecting on J Pow to hint at a timeline
of tapering.  Feels market still doesn't get Fed's new MPF.
"Substantial further progress" and "consistent above 2% inflation" are very clear
goals. Fed will not do any forecasting and will use only *realized* readings.

[Reuters: Fed's Kaplan warns on 'imbalances,' wants to talk taper](

Kaplan, non-FOMC voting member, sounds quite hawkish. He wants Fed to start
talking about tapering soon and also wants Fed to hike soon. This is all
very hawkish compared with J Pow's perspective.

> "More subtly but just as importantly, what the periodic bouts of illiquidity
in Treasuries are suggestive of is investor herding. The real recipe for a
liquid and stable market is a heterogeneous market: Buyers and sellers,
bottom-up investors and top-down investors, mark-to-market investors and buy-and-hold investors.

> Somehow what we seem to have done post-2008 is to take a whole load of steps,
which are individually designed to make the system safer, but collectively have
killed off that heterogeneity and made for one-sided markets. The bottom-up,
value-based, non-mark-to-market investor — they've been killed off by a decade of
quantitative easing making everything more expensive and by regulators demanding
everyone take a risk-based approach to capital. That gives you a market in which investors
get herded into a broad-based reach for yield that they don't really believe in.
And that gives you those pockets of illiquidity: We don't get one and
two-standard-deviation movements any more — we either get zero or we get 16."
