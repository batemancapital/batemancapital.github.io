Consensus has shifted to early take-off in 2023. This is a slightly hawkish
FOMC meeting.

[WSJ: For Many Home Buyers, a 5% Down Payment Isnâ€™t Enough](
https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-many-home-buyers-a-5-down-payment-isnt-enough-11624095181?mod=markets_lead_pos1)

> Many buyers are still getting offers accepted without putting 20% down. First-time home buyers who used mortgages paid 9.1% down on average year-to-date through mid-May, though that is up from 8.4% for all of 2020, according to CoreLogic. Repeat buyers paid 16.6% down on average.

I'm already very surprised by the fact that less than half of the people cannot
put down 20% downpayment.
