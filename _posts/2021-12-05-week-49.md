Rosenberg interview:

> The dollar had a pickup because of the reset of interest rate expectations by
> the Fed at a time when the ECB has pushed back on rate hike expectations out
> of Europe. So part of that strengthening move has happened against the Euro.
> But it’s been quite broadly based, mostly in view of Fed Chair Powell
> starting to sound less dovish and more hawkish after the September FOMC
> meeting. That’s when the U.S. dollar started to circle around. In my view,
> this dollar rally has a short shelf life because interest rate expectations
> are going to head in the opposite direction next year. Hence, I am more of a
> dollar bear than a dollar bull, especially at today’s levels.
