[Fed:

Quarles offers opinion on how to get a better reading of inflation.

> curve: anchored inflation expectations.

Again, anchored inflation expectation is very important.

>  For instance, most of the September Summary of Economic Projections
>  forecasts for PCE inflation in 2022 were between 1.9 and 2.3 percent, with a
>  minimum of 1.7 percent and a maximum of 3.0 percent.3 But I see significant
>  upside risks to my current inflation outlook.

Again, upside risks to inflation outlook.

> The fundamental dilemma that we face at the Fed right now is this: Demand,
> augmented by unprecedented fiscal stimulus, has been outstripping a
> temporarily disrupted supply, leading to high inflation. But the fundamental
> productive capacity of our economy as it existed just before COVID—and, thus,
> the ability to satisfy that demand without inflation—remains largely as it
> was, and the factors that are disrupting it appear to be transitory. Looked
> at purely in that light, constraining demand now, to bring it into line with
> a transiently interrupted supply, would be premature. Given the lags with
> which monetary policy acts, we could easily find that demand is damping just
> as supply is increasing, leading us to undershoot our inflation target—and,
> in the worst case, we could depress the incentives for supply to return,
> leading to an extended period of sluggish activity and unnecessarily low
> employment.

This part is really very well said. It captures the dilemma Fed is facing now.

>  If inflation does remain more than moderately above 2 percent, be assured
>  that the FOMC has the framework and the tools to address it.

> If those dynamics should lead this "transitory" inflation to continue too
> long, it could affect the planning of households and businesses and unanchor
> their inflation expectations. This could spark a wage-price spiral that would
> not settle down even when the logistical bottlenecks and supply chain kinks
> have eased. 

Could not be said more clearly.
