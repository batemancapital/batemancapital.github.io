[CBO: The 2021 Long-Term Budget Outlook](

The U.S. deficit will inevitably go much higher in long term.

> Persistently rising debt as a percentage of GDP would
also pose significant risks to the fiscal and economic outlook, although financial markets currently do not reflect
those concerns. In particular, that debt path would have
these economic and financial effects:


> • It would increase the risk of a fiscal crisis—that is,
a situation in which investors lose confidence in
the U.S. government’s ability to service and repay
its debt, causing interest rates to increase abruptly,
inflation to spiral upward, or other disruptions—and
> • It would increase the likelihood of less abrupt, but
still significant, adverse effects, such as expectations
of higher rates of inflation, an erosion of confidence
in the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency,
and more difficulty in financing public and private
activity in international markets.

> CBO expects
the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities,
measured as a share of GDP, to begin declining in 2024,
which would put modest upward pressure on long-term
interest rates.
