One of the best Weekend Long Reads by Foroohar: an excellent recount
of dot-com bubble in 2000. Its resemblance to the tech unicorn bubble is
striking. The story also mentioned deregulation in 1990 that led to the
bubble:

> It was the roaring ’90s after all, in London as well as in Silicon
Valley. If the 1980s began the age of greed, then the late 1990s cemented
it. It was the era of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, who continued much of the
market deregulation that had started under Reagan and Thatcher. It was a
period when the notion of retiring comfortably with a gold watch and a
pension began to slip away, replaced by soccer moms reading Money magazine
and hoping to become stockpicking millionaires overnight.
