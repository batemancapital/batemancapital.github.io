situation is at odds with its justifiable characterisation as a big
bureaucracy. Evidence suggests the view is accurate nonetheless.

FOMC Minutes was released this Wednesday. Snider points out again that
Fed does not understand the bond market:

> “bond market” as a euphemism for the wider global monetary and financial system, all
those liquidity and economic indicators that unlike the Fed’s models
have done a bang-up job assessing economic, financial,
and liquidity risks (mid-September’s repo rumble was no surprise).

investors.
