title: Bateman Capital 2019 Year End Review
category: posts

#### Market overview

Year end is coming and Bateman Capital is having its first year anniversary.
Year of 2019 is an amazing year and Bateman Capital has been following
along. It is now a good time to have a look at the market throughout 2019.

#### Fed / Money Market

Let's start with the Fed (or shall we say _FedSpeak_).

Following the market sell-off in late 2018,  U.S. Federal Reserve changed
its tone on monetary policy and moved
to a "patient" stance. As deepening U.S.-China trade war started to hurt
economic outlook, yield curve became inverted. In August, Fed delivered
its first 25bps rate cut in 2019, followed by two 25bps rate cuts in September
and October. Reacting to repo market turmoil in September, Fed injected
massive amount of liquidity into overnight and term repo market
by purchasing T-Bills and is prepared to inject more as year end gets closer.
Fed's balance sheet dramatically increased around $400bn and completely
went back to level at the beginning of 2019 [^1]. Fed officials consider current
Fed Fund rate range (1.50% to 1.75%) appropriate and see no rate
change in 2020.


It is remarkable that Fed carried out a complete U-turn of its monetary
policy in 2019. Since January, rate market has been leading the Fed. 2-year,
3-year, 5-year, and 10-year swap rate all fell below Fed Funds rate,
indicating market expected Fed to lower rate. Starting from middle of
2019, the spread between 2-year Treasury yield and 10-year Treasury
yield briefly dipped below zero while spread between 3-month Treasury
bills yield and 10-year Treasury yield remained below zero for a few
months. As Fed started cutting rates, curve started to steepen in November.

Yield curve has been a good recession indicator [^2], usually leading recession
from 18 months to 24 months. Fed cuts will ease the market condition, steepening
the curve. Then recession will follow. However, two precautionary cuts in
1995 and 1998 did not lead to recession. For now, Fed considers three fed cuts
in 2019 precautionary.

In September FOMC meeting, participants gave their opinion on inverted yield curve,
according to the minutes [^3]:

> Several participants noted that statistical models designed to gauge the
probability of recession, including those based on information from the yield
curve, suggested that the likelihood of a recession occurring over the medium
term had increased notably in recent months. However, a couple of these
participants stressed the difficulty of extracting the right signal from
these probability models, especially in the current period of unusually
low levels of **term premiums**

Here is a FedSpeak: "**term premiums**". For interested readers,
there is no better
better article that debunks the word "term premiums" than Snider's post
this year [^4].

On inflation, Fed raised concern over low inflation expectation in the
past few years. During press conference after FOMC October meeting [^5],
Powell said:

> You come back to the question of raising rates. So **that’s really about inflation**. And you
know, we haven’t yet—we just touched 2 percent core inflation, to pick one measure—just
touched it for a few months, and then we’ve fallen back. **So I think we would need to see a
really significant move up in inflation that’s persistent before we would consider raising rates to
address inflation concerns**.

This is the one of the most important remarks Powell has made this year
but it could be easily ignored by many investors. First, Fed wants to see
significantly higher inflation rate that should go above
its targeted 2% rate. According to Financial Times [^6], Fed is considering to change
its policy such that it will "raise inflation target when it misses its
inflation target to make up for lost inflation". Second,
Fed emphasized that higher inflation must be persistent. A brief touch of
its target inflation rate is simply not enough to make Fed even consider
raising rates. Fed is determined to bring inflation expectation back, like
other major central banks around the world like BoJ and ECB which
are having difficult time to anchor inflation expectation.

According to Reuters [^7], Fed used 31 times **Fedspeak word "symmetric"**
to describe Fed inflation rate since last December. For example, in
2019 December FOMC statement:

> The Committee judges that the current stance of monetary policy is
appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity,
strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the
Committee's **symmetric 2 percent objective** [^8]. 

Reuters continued:

> “Symmetric” was used to describe the inflation target in a January 2017 Fed
statement of long-term strategy. At that point it was intended to make clear
that 2% was not an upper limit on the pace of price increases, and to
counter criticism that the Fed only cared if inflation was too high.

Indeed, Fed governer Lael Brainard also mentioned how Fed plans to 
better achieve its inflation target after pointing out Fed is cautious of
deflation pressure around the world [^9]. In the speech, another new
FedSpeak appeared: **"opportunistic reflation"**.

> In this context and as part of our review, my colleagues and I have been
discussing how to better anchor inflation expectations firmly at our objective.
In particular, it may be helpful to specify that policy aims to achieve
inflation outcomes that average 2 percent over time or over the cycle.
Given the persistent shortfall of inflation from its target over recent years,
this would imply supporting inflation a bit **above 2 percent for some
time to compensate** for the period of underperformance.

> Committee would make clear in advance that it would accommodate rather than
offset modest upward pressures to inflation in what could be described as a
process of **opportunistic reflation**.

It is bizarre that Fed is cautious against deflation risk and even wants to
use higher inflation to compensate past inflation target misses. Is 2%
inflation not inflation? If one checks out total outstanding Federal
debt[^10] and debt-to-gdp ratio [^11], he will
understand United States debt situation is not sustainable. Fed knows this.
It really makes one wonder if Fed intentionally keeps inflation rate higher
than interest rate to debase debt. Reinhart and Rogoff has pointed out
the problem of excessive debt in their book
"This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly" [^12]:

> If there is one common theme to the vast range of crises we consider
in this book, it is that excessive debt accumulation,
whether it be by government, banks, corporations or consumers,
often poses greater systemic risks than it seems during a boom.

#### Debt / Bond Market

Let's now focus on debt situation in the world.

In September FOMC meeting, Fed participants raised concern over U.S. corporate
debt problem [^8]:

> Several participants cited considerations that led them to be concerned
about financial stability, including low risk spreads and a buildup of
corporate debt, corporate stock buybacks financed through low-cost
leverage, and the pace of lending in the CRE market. However, several
others pointed to signs that the financial system remained resilient.

This year corporate bond issuance has set global record as cooperations
take advantage of low interest rates [^13]. Outstanding student loan 
has ballooned to $1.9tn [^14] and seven-year auto loan keeps growing [^15].
In March, BIS warned over massive accumulation of triple-B cooperate debt [^16].
Triple-B corporate debt is vunerable to economic slowdown as it is the bottom
of investment grade bond, being only one notch away from junk bond rating. Fund manager
of investment grade bond portfolio will have to unload downgraded triple-B
corporate bonds in a recession environment, which will lead to rapid fire sale.

Over the world, negative yielding debt took the stage this summer, with German
10-year Bund being traded near -0.7% yield. Negative interest rate
policy and negative yielding debt in eurozone and Japan brought huge
pressure to pension funds [^17]. Pension fund managers are forced to look into
risky asset like private equity to deliver yield, introducing more
instability into the financial system [^18]. Ultra-low yield environment
in eurozone and Japan keeps Treasury demand high. Their unhedged carry trades
keep dollar strong.

#### Stock market

As Fed's monetary policy U-turn unfolds, stock market goes up from its
sell-off at the end of 2018. S&P 500 is now up 29% YTD and Nasdaq is up 35% YTD.

Year of 2019 is full of tech company IPOs. Loss-making companies swarmed
into stock market and are traded significantly below their IPO prices
now. WeWork IPO failure and SoftBank's reckless investing behavior
delivered a good show for all the market watchers. Meanwhile, big companies
[^20] are taking advantage of tax break and low interest environment to buy
back their stocks, pushing stock prices to all-time-high.

In genernal, Bateman Capital holds the view that U.S. stock market is
overvalued. We will not go deep into stock market here as Bateman Capital
has little focus on stock market.

#### View of market in 2020

Bateman Capital's view of 2020: after Fed's three cuts, the U.S. stock
market should remain buoyant in 2020 but with limited upside. Inflation
will be running hot. Treasury bond yields should be going above 2% and
yield curve will steepen. Dollar will weaken and gold should
hold above $1400/oz.


#### Best read of 2019

Besides following the market, Bateman Capital also had a few good reads in 2019:

[Stigum's Money Market, 4E, by Marcia Stigum, Anthony Crescenzi](https://www.mhprofessional.com/9780071448451-usa-stigums-money-market-4e-group)

[This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, by Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff](
https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691152646/this-time-is-different)

This time is never different: excessive debt accumulation always leads to financial crisis.

[Exorbitant Privilege, The Rise and Fall of the Dollar and the Future of the International Monetary
System, by Barry Eichengreen](
https://global.oup.com/academic/product/exorbitant-privilege-9780199753789)

Dollar's global reserve currency status remains unchallenged so far but U.S
domestic debt problem could bring dollar to its knees eventually.

Bateman Capital's favorite investors are Jeffrey Gundlach[^21] and
Harley S. Bassman [^22]. Their interview and blog provide great insight
into the market.
