[Fed (Waller): Economic Outlook](
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20211119a.htm)

Incresaingly hawkish statement from Waller.

> inflation pressures are becoming more widespread and may last longer into 2022 than I thought they would

> Despite the highest wage gains in years, inflation this year has wiped out any real wage increase for the average worker.

> It has been argued that because price pressures connected to supply
> constraints are transitory, they will come to an end, so monetary policy does
> not need to respond to temporary price pressures.

> but for my part the rapid improvement in the labor market and the
> deteriorating inflation data have pushed me towards favoring a faster pace of
> tapering and a more rapid removal of accommodation in 2022.

> Assuming inflation expectations are well-anchored, I judge that the timing of
> liftoff is any time after both of these conditions have been met.

[BBG: Red-Hot Housing Market Drives Biggest Home-Equity Drawdown Since 2007](

Seems like a red flag. In other words, confidence is very high.

>While taking advantage of the extra cash may seem like a no brainer, it’s far
>from a risk-free option. Homeowners are ultimately increasing the debt load on
>their property and shrinking their available equity. If housing values were to
>fall, that could leave them owing more than their property is worth or with
>too high a loan-to-value ratio to refinance down the line.
