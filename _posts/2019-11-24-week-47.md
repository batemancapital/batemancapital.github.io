[Federal Reserve: Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee](
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20191030.htm)

Fed discussed negative interest rate, yield-curve control, and standing repo
facility.

Negative interest rate:

> All participants judged that negative interest rates currently
did not appear to be an attractive monetary policy tool in the United States.

> Notwithstanding these considerations, participants did not rule out
the possibility that circumstances could arise in which it might be
appropriate to reassess the potential role of negative interest
rates as a policy tool.

Yield-curve control:

> participants discussed the benefits and costs of using balance sheet
tools to cap rates on short- or long-maturity Treasury
securities through open market operations as necessary

> Some of those participants noted ... or that managing longer-term
interest rates might be seen as interacting with the federal debt management process.

Gundlach already pointed out Fed recent decision of monetizing T-Bills can
be treated as pushing down Treasury long-term yield, as the decision will
encourage Treasury to issue more short-term bills.

> A standing fixed-rate repo facility would likely provide substantial
assurance of control over the federal funds rate, but use of the
facility could become stigmatized, particularly if the rate was
set at a relatively high level.

[FT Opinion (Philip Stafford): The absence of fear is a little scary in itself](
https://www.ft.com/content/d94c8962-07c3-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd)

VIX short is at all-time high and long period of low VIX is often followed by
sudden spike of VIX in past year. Trade war could escalate in December
(December tariff applied + Hong Kong situation escalation) but QE4 may save the market.
