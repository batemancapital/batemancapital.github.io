[Federal Reserve System: Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, November 4-5, 2020](
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20201125a.htm)

Highlights:

> While participants judged that immediate adjust- ments to the pace and
> composition of asset purchases were not necessary, they recognized that
> circumstances could shift to warrant such adjustments. Accordingly,
> participants saw the ongoing careful consideration of potential next steps
> for enhancing the Committee’s guid- ance for its asset purchases as
> appropriate...

> Still, participants generally judged that asset purchases would continue to
> support smooth mar- ket functioning, and many judged that asset purchases
> helped provide insurance against risks that might reemerge in financial
> markets in an environment of high uncertainty. A few participants indicated
> that asset pur- chases could also help guard against undesirable upward
> pressure on longer-term rates that could arise, for exam- ple, from
> higher-than-expected Treasury debt issuance. Several participants noted the
> possibility that there may be limits to the amount of additional
> accommodation that could be provided through increases in the Federal
> Reserve’s asset holdings in light of the low level of longer-term yields, and
> they expressed concerns that a significant expansion in asset holdings could
> have unintended consequences...

> Participants noted that the Committee could provide more accommodation, if
> appropriate, by in- creasing the pace of purchases or by shifting its
> Treasury purchases to those with a longer maturity without in- creasing the
> size of its purchases...

> Mortgage rates remained near historical lows, supporting high volumes of
> both home-purchase and refinancing origi- nations. Credit continued to flow
> to higher-score bor- rowers meeting standard conforming loan criteria, while
> it remained tight for borrowers with lower credit scores and for nonstandard
> mortgage products...

> In consumer credit markets, conditions remained ac- commodative for borrowers
> with relatively strong credit scores but continued to be tight for borrowers
> with sub- prime credit scores...

> However, several participants expressed concern that, in the ab- sence of
> additional fiscal support, lower- and moderate- income households might need
> to reduce their spending sharply when their savings were exhausted...

> Many participants judged that the Committee might want to enhance its
> guidance for asset purchases fairly soon. Most participants fa- vored moving
> to qualitative outcome-based guidance for asset purchases that links the
> horizon over which the Committee anticipates it would be conducting asset
> pur- chases to economic conditions. A few participants were hesitant to make
> changes in the near term to the guid- ance for asset purchases and pointed to
> considerable un- certainty about the economic outlook and the appropri- ate
> use of balance sheet policies given that uncertainty...

[SK option trading: What Future US Monetary Policy Means For Gold Prices](

Back in 2011, SK option trading wrote a blog on 'Operation Twist' - Fed moving
bond purchase to longer end of the curve.

> If Fed easing, whatever form it takes, is successful at improving the
> economic outlook then this is not bullish for gold prices over the medium
> term. An improving economic outlook would probably see longer term US real
> interest rates increase, the yield curve steepen (unless longer term rates
> are specifically capped) and therefore flow through to a decrease in gold
> prices.

Not much comment on this article, except this could be some interesting
trend in U.S. worth watching. The massive asset transfer to millennials could
mean a lot more inflows to ESG investing.
