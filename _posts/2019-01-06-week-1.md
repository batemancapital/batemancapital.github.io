## Market/General

[FT: The Federal Reserve versus the markets: who has it wrong?](https://www.ft.com/content/3401af9e-09ec-11e9-9fe8-acdb36967cfc)

this reminds me the Q&A given by ex Goldman CEO Blankfein at the company I work for:
> I am a market guy. I start from the market, trying to understand what's going on...

Anyway, turns out Fed changed its tone later.

> Market are pricing in downside risks, and they're well ahead of the data.

It is from the same group of people who manage FPNIX. Interesting they choose
this time to launch a fund with more BBB exposure.

[FT: Japan risks creating ‘immigration problem’ warns opposition leader](https://www.ft.com/content/78c9d0f4-08d7-11e9-9fe8-acdb36967cfc)

Japan starts talking about immigration and we all know what the conversation looks like.
I am already very surprised congress can pass some immigration law changes last
year. Japan historically is not an immigration/ethnically-diverse country. Its society
in general does not welcome foreign immigrants. Is labor shortage such a
pressing concern so that Japan is opening up immigration? Is there any other reason?

I should read Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn's story again, which seems related to
Japan's justice system, immigration system and how foreigners are treated in the
society.

That said, if Japan offers immigration advantage to property investors, I'll be
seriously considering it...

Learned a bit about R this weekend. I can sense this is a very powerful language. I would
like to spend more time on it.
