title: A few thoughts after market crash
category: posts
---

Since market crash in early March due to COVID-led panic response, Federal
Reserve has been aggressively easing monetary condition - bring Fed Funds rate
back to zero, start unlimited QE, launch various facility to support credit
market. Meanwhile U.S. government ramped up fiscal policy support - trillons
of dollars here, trillons of dollars there.

The money printer is on. Progress on medicine and vaccine
development supports the narratives for V-shaped economy. Nasdaq 100 index
almost went back to all-time high, despite of 38.6 million people unemployed and drastically
lowered earnings expectation. One has to amaze at the delusion fuelled by
massive amount liquidity unleashed by the Fed. The adage "Don't fight the Fed"
proves itself again.

With 10-year breakeven inflation rate at 1.12, 5y5y inflation swap at 1.44,
10yr yield at sub 70 bps, and 5yr yield at around 30 bps, market prices in
no sign of inflation in short term and slow recovery of
inflation in long term. Ballsdon's [analysis on rate market](https://www.thegreyfirehorse.com/post/japanification-of-the-us-rates-market-now-complete)
demonstrate that the 'Japanification' of U.S. rate market should be expected.
Some market participants bet Fed could cut rate to negative but so far
Fed officials are clear they will not adopt NIRP.

I wonder if the global economy is capable of kicking the can down
the road again. While arguments like high debt-to-gdp level both in
public and private sectors, domestic demography issue, and deglobalization
prove it is reasonable to expect a gloomy future, past history of can-kicking
shows that if crisis happens, people can "solve" it by just throwing at it
more debt. The irony is that more debt brings more fragility into the
system and slows down economic growth, which eventually leads to more crisis.
A pessimist like me sees low chance the loop will break this time. Expansion
of fiscal policy (e.g. program that improves infrastructure) could potentially
grow the economy out by introducing real GDP growth. There
are also voices calling for debt jubilee and MMT, yet I doubt our current system can easily
adopt either of the choices. Debt jubilee exerts too much pain on the beneficiaries
in the society and will be rejected by the ruling class. MMT, or Fed direct financing
of government debt, requires change on Federal Reserve Act and there is concern
it could lead to rampant inflation.

Anyway, in short term, I believe the volatility in the market could kick back
if the liquidity crisis evolves into solvency crisis. Right now the market
now looks so quiet in the past few weeks that it almost looks
like nothing has happened since March. Hopefully, the next few months
could become more exciting.
